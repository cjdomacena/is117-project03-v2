                                    person that has access to the internet. It is hard to imagine living in today’s age
                                    without internet access and access to information. Research papers, essays, and
                                    homework are made easier to do by the internet. Almost all resources are available
                                    online.

                                <p>
                                    Two electrical engineering students, Jerry Yang, and David Filo, at Stanford
                                    University in their quest to scour the web for information about their basketball
                                    fantasy draft have found themselves endlessly searching for information and suddenly
                                    had an idea to make it easier for themselves and organized the websites to make
                                    navigation easier. They created a website called “Jerry and David’s guide to the
                                    World Wide Web”. The site was a directory of other websites, organized in a
                                    hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. And it was hit and used by
                                    millions of people. Their website then changed into Yahoo due to its characters
                                    being too long for an easily accessible domain.

                                    In the mid-’90s, even though the popularity of the internet, its popularity did not
                                    generate income. When Mosaic was first launched, the first web browser, even though
                                    it had millions of users, there were no ways to generate income but charge users for
                                    its application. And this is where advertising came in. It ushered the way for small
                                    companies to generate income and grow to such an unprecedented rate.

                                    Yahoo decided then to launch advertisements on their websites and was completely
                                    worried, and afraid of alienating their loyal users. But, as time went on the number
                                    of users continued to grow which means more eyes on the advertisements posted on
                                    their website.

                                    A company that rivaled yahoo at that time. A pure software company that is much
                                    superior to Yahoo’s website. Instead of Yahoo’s directories, Excite does the work
                                    for you- type in a query, the software does its job for you- it scours the web and

                                            accessible in public. Due to this rise, a bunch of tech companies started to
                                            pop up
                                            in silicon valley hoping that they can turn their idea into profits.

                                    As multitude of users continued to grow, companies like Yahoo and Excite reinvented
                                    themselves into portals - a one-stop destination packed with diversions from chat
                                    rooms, emails, stock tickers - to prevent users from leaving their site and to
                                    consume their advertisements. As a result, this created an extreme competition and
                                    resulted in extreme innovations, but it is unsustainable for some of the other
                                    companies who can’t keep up.

                                    While Yahoo, Excite, and other search engine companies kept raking in profits for
                                    their sites, they lost track of what they were initially doing: being a search
                                    engine.

                                <p>Google was created as a research project by two Ph.D. students at Stanford
                                    University. Larry Page and Sergey Brin had an idea on how to make a better search
                                    engine that ranks results by counting the number of times the search terms appeared
                                    on the page. This algorithm was then called PageRank; it determined a website’s rank
                                    by the number of pages it is linked to and the original page will be the first link
                                    to be shown.
                                </p>

                                <p>At the time, Yahoo was dominating its other competitors, and its main rival is
                                    Excite. To help Excite fight back, a venture capitalist introduced Google to them
                                    and Google was hoping to be bought out. But Excite’s CEO was not impressed by
                                    Google’s program. It was not only Excite who did not see Google’s full potential but
                                    almost every other company in Silicon Valley.</p>

                                    Determined to help fund Google, Page and Brin met with David Cheriton, a Stanford
                                    University computer science professor, and Sun Microsystems co-founder Andy
                                    Bechtolsheim, they have pitched their search engine and Bechtolsheim was amazed and
                                    wrote Google company a $100,000 check to kickstart their company. Other investors
                                    also contributed and made up one million dollars that helped start Google’s uprise.
                                    And by 1999, Google received a total amount of more than 20$ million dollars.

                                    As Google continues to establish itself, Bechtolsheim and its founders’ vision did
                                    not stop at scouring the internet in the U.S, but they wanted to extend their vision
                                    to make it global, accessible to everyone in the world. However, the same problem
                                    arises at Google: how do we make money? Should they follow the likes of Yahoo and
                                    other search engines alike with their advertising strategy, or to innovate a new way
                                    to advertise to generate revenue? Both original investors could not think of having
                                    Google be the likes of Yahoo.

                                    Bill Gross is the founder of Idealab. He found a way to curate advertisements based
                                    on keywords. The idea behind Gross’s strategy is: whenever a user searches for or
                                    types a keyword in the search engine it will display a related advertisement to the
                                    page. This way advertisements will not look like a randomly generated advertisement
                                    and would not annoy users. Furthermore, these keywords are sold to companies so
                                    every time a user types the keyword companies who bought the keywords to advertise
                                    will show it to the page. Google found this idea and contacted Bill Gross to have a
                                    meeting on how Google would implement Gross’s idea to its own search engine.

                                <p>After numerous meetings between Google and Gross, Page and Brin walked away with no
                                    any kind of deal. And after a few months, Google released Adwords. Adwords is
                                    suspiciously similar to Gross’s idea. Gross took Google to court and he walked away
                                    with a settlement.</p>

                                    In 2004, Google went public but with a lot of doubt within wall street because of
                                    their unconventional way of selling their stocks. However, once they went public,
                                    their opening was a whopping success. Their stock price never went down below $100.
